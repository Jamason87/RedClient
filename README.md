This is an app that allows users to curate their own, personalized, collection of Funko Pop figures.

This app is where a user can view their collection, and add/remove Funkos as their collection changes.

The wishlist is where the user can go to tag Funkos they don't currently own, but would like to add to their collection in the future.

The idea of this app is to emulate and mirror the users physical Funko Pop collection on hand and this app would be a tool on the go if a user can't readily remember what they own.

Future plans for the app include a message board where users can view each others wishlist items and sell, trade, or give another user the Funko pop they are chasing for their own collection.
